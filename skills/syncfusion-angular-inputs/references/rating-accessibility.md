## WAI-ARIA Attributes

The Rating component follows the [WAI-ARIA slider pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/slider/).

| Attribute | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `role="slider"` | Identifies the input as a range slider |
| `role="button"` | Applied to the reset button |
| `aria-label` | Provides an accessible name for the rating |
| `aria-valuemin` | Defines the minimum rating value |
| `aria-valuemax` | Defines the maximum rating value |
| `aria-valuenow` | Reflects the current selected value |
| `aria-hidden` | Applied to the reset button when not interactive |

These are applied automatically — no manual ARIA configuration is needed.

---

## Keyboard Navigation

The Rating component supports full keyboard interaction following the [WAI-ARIA keyboard interaction guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/slider/#keyboardinteraction):

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Arrow Up` | Increases the rating value |
| `Arrow Right` | Increases the rating value (decreases in RTL mode) |
| `Arrow Down` | Decreases the rating value |
| `Arrow Left` | Decreases the rating value (increases in RTL mode) |
| `Space` | When the **reset button** is focused, resets to `min` value |

---

## RTL Support

Enable right-to-left layout using `enableRtl`:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { RatingModule } from '@syncfusion/ej2-angular-inputs';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <div class="wrap">
      <input ejs-rating id="rating" [value]="3" [enableRtl]="true"/>
    </div>
  `,
  standalone: true,
  imports: [RatingModule],
})
export class AppComponent { }
```

In RTL mode:
- Arrow Right **decreases** the value.
- Arrow Left **increases** the value.
- The component layout is mirrored.

## Ensuring Accessibility

Accessibility compliance is verified through automated tools:

- **[accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker)** — automated WCAG/Section 508 validation.
- **[axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core)** — browser-based accessibility testing.

The Rating component passes both tools without configuration. To evaluate compliance in your app, run these tools against the page containing the rating component.

## Tips

- Always provide a meaningful `aria-label` if the rating context isn't clear from surrounding text.
- Combine `[showLabel]="true"` with the rating to give screen reader users a text representation of the current value.
- Use `[readOnly]="true"` (not `[disabled]="true"`) for display-only ratings to keep them focusable and accessible.
